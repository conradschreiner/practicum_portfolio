# Forecasting and Predictions Project

## Overview

* This folder contains one .ipynb jupyter notebook file:
- forecasting_final

## Project Description

* This was the last project in the course prior to the final project. The main focus of it was the training machine learning algorithms to predict user churn. I started by exploring the data using graphs I plotted with matplotlib and seaborn, then moved on to training algorithms from python's sklearn library. I ended the report with an analysis of the user groups that I created using machine learning. 

Stages:

1. Download the Data
2. Carry out Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Build a Model to Predict User Churn
4. Create User Clusters
5. Conclusions and Recommendations

Libraries used in my python code:

- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- sklearn


The project was completed locally on my mac using jupyter notebook and datasets provided by Practicum.
