## Project Description

* This was the 7th project of the course and was focused on drawing conclusions from an A/B test analysis. The premise of the project was that I acted as a data analyst at a large online store. My task was to prioritize the best hypotheses for boosting revenue out of a list of 9 using ICE and RICE frameworks. Following that I evaluated the A/B test using statistical tests to see which hypotheses were the most effective at boosting revenue. 

Stages:

1. Prioritizing Hypotheses
2. A/B Test Analysis Data Preprocessing
3. A/B Test Analysis
4. Conclusions and Recommendations

Libraries used in my code:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scipy


The project was completed locally on my mac using jupyter notebook and datasets provided by Practicum.
