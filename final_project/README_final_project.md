# Final Project

## Overview

* This folder contains three .ipynb jupyter notebook files:
- ab_testing_final
- sql_final
- final_project

* Each project is independent but all of them were completed over the course of two weeks as the final stage of the course as a way of testing and applying the skills that I have learned. In every project the main programming langauge that is utilize is Python.

## Project Descriptions

### ab_testing_final

* The goal of the project was to evaluate the results of an A/B test that a hypothetical predecessor/coworker failed to complete. The dataset contains multiple issues that I was forced to deal with prior to actually evaulating the A/B test. After evaluating the test I had to make a decision on whether or not to stop the test and to assess its validity. 

Stages:

1. Download the Data
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Carry out Exploratory Data Analysis
4. Evaluate the A/B Test Results
5. Conclusions and Recommendations

Libraries used in my code:

- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- plotly
- scipy


The project was completed locally on my mac using jupyter notebook and datasets provided by Practicum.

### sql_final

* The goal of the project was to analyze a database of a hypothetical book reader focused startup and provide information to be used to gnerate a value proposition for a new product provided by the startup. The main goal of this project was to practice SQL usig sqlAlchemy in jupyter notebooks. I connected to a database provided by practicum and then ran querys and answered questions that were provided. 

Stages:

1. Describe the Goals of the Study
2. Study the Tables
3. Make an SQL Query for each of the tasks and Output the Results in the Notebook
4. Conclusions and Recommendations

Libraries used in my code:

- psycopg2
- pandas
- sqlalchemy
- postgreSQL

The project was completed locally on my mac using jupyter notebook.


### final_project 

* The goal of the final project of the course was to assess the performance of the sales outlets of a hypothetical building project distributor named Home World. Before completing this project I had to provide a decomposition/overview of each step, how I would complete each task and why. It should also be noted that I practiced training a machine learning model for the purpose of predicting membership in a customer loyaltly program, but concluded I was not provided with enough data features for a proper predictive model. 

Stages:

1. Download the Data and Import Libraries
2. Data Proprocessing
3. Exploratory Data Analysis
4. Assess the Performance of the Sales Outlets
5. Test Statistical Hypotheses
6. Conclusions and Recommendations

Libraries used in my code:

- numpy
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scipy
- plotly
- sklearn

The project was completed locally on my mac using jupyter notebook using datasets provided by Practicum.
